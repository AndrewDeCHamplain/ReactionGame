This game uses 3 raspberry pi boards to test the reaction time of 2 people. One pi acts as the server, connecting the 
other 2 boards and displaying the interface for the game. The server implements sockets to create a tcp connection. This 
connection requires that the client's programs have the server pi's ip.
