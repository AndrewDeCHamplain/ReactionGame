This game uses 3 raspberry pi boards to test the reaction time of 2 people. One pi acts as the server, connecting the 
other 2 boards and displaying the interface for the game. The server implements sockets to create a tcp connection. This 
connection requires that the client's programs have the server pi's ip.


The Gertboard used GPIO 23-25 as buttons by setting their mode to output and placing jumpers from GP25 -> J3 B1, 
GP24 -> J3 B2, GP23 -> J3 B3. The buttons also required headers connecting U3 B1 - B3 to out. For the LED's that 
displayed the random LED, their GPIO mode was set to output for GP6-GP9. Jumpers were used to connect GP10 -> J3 B9,
GP9 -> J3 B10, GP8 -> J3 B11, and GP7 -> J3 B12 and the headers connect to U5 B9-B12 out. The header on U5 B9 is not 
used for the game but in just there to turn off LED D9 so it is not confused with when LED D10 is lit up.
