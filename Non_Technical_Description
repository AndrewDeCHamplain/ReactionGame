The game we have made to test the network and peripheral capabilities of the Raspberry Pi involves the use of three
Raspberry Pi Systems; one connected to a GertBoard, one connected to a PiFace and the other on its own. The pi without any
peripheral attachments is used as a server that can communicate with the other pi systems. It is in charge of starting the
game and computing the results. The two Pi systems with peripheral attachments (We will call them clients) are programmed 
to start the game when they receive a message from the server, which is only sent when both clients connect to the server.

The game, which is run entirely by the clients, is very simple. There are LED lights on each board that correspond to a
button. In one round of the game, there is a countdown, then a random LED will turn on. The player must push this button
as fast as possible (They are being timed). The time taken to push the button is sent to the server. When both clients
have finished 10 rounds, the game will end and the server will display the average reaction times of the two competitors.
The players can either rematch or quit from there.
